# Predicting-Insurance-Premium-Using-Python

In today's data-driven world, the insurance industry is undergoing a significant transformation by leveraging the power of data science. Data science, a multidisciplinary field that combines statistical analysis, machine learning, and predictive modelling, is revolutionizing the way insurance premiums are calculated. This project involves training and tesing various predictive models to determine which will be most efficient in predicting the Insurance Premium of an individual or a customer.

### **Understanding Insurance Premiums:**

Insurance premiums are the periodic payments made by policy holders to insurance companies in exchange for coverage against potential risks or losses. Traditionally, insurers relied on actuarial tables and historical data to assess risk and calculate premiums. However, this approach often led to generalized premium rates that didn't reflect an individual's specific risk profile accurately.
